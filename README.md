# javascript-mine-sweeper
This is the begins of a Mine Sweeper clone using pure vanilla Javascript. Currently, the script setups a basic game board with questions mark 
buttons for the game pieces. When a user clicks on a question mark button it will either show a "1" (ie. bomb) or a "0" (ie. not a bomb).
